## Quick Verification Commands

```powershell
# 1. Format code
.\format-code.ps1

# 2. Clean build
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force build -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

# 3. Run tests
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure

# 4. Verify executables
.\build\my_cli_tool.exe
.\build\my_gui_tool.exe
.\build\my_catch2_tests.exe
.\build\my_gtest_tests.exe
```

## Artemis Environment Notes

- Build environment provides Qt6, Catch2, and GoogleTest
- Code should compile cleanly with no warnings
- All tests must pass
- Report should be in Markdown format
- Code formatting should be consistent (clang-format)

## Final Submission Steps

1. **Final Code Review**: Ensure all code is clean and well-documented
2. **Build Verification**: Complete clean build with no errors/warnings  
3. **Test Verification**: All tests pass consistently
4. **Report Review**: Report is complete and professional
5. **Format Check**: All code properly formatted with clang-format
6. **Submit to Artemis**: Upload your complete project
